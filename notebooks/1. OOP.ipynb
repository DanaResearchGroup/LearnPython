    "# 1. Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a style of programming that promotes the creation of objects to contain data and methods. Codes developed using OOP will contain a set of objects that interact with one another. Each object will consist of three main types of information:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Constructor - A way to construct an instance of the object.\n",
    "                  The process of constructing an object using its Constructor\n",
    "                  is called \"creating an instance of an object\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    Data - Each object instance may contain data relevant to it.\n",
    "           These are often stored as variables within the object instance.\n",
    "           Data is often assigned values through the Constructor,\n",
    "           and each instance of an object may have different values assigned to its data\n",
    "           upon initiallization.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Methods - Functions defined within a class are usually called \"methods\" rather than \"functions\".\n",
    "              Similar to a function a method has a name, a set of zero or more parameters,\n",
    "              and optionally a return value.\n",
    "              Methods usually operate on the data within an object,\n",
    "              sometimes utilizing information provided from outside the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Four main concepts of OOP are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Encapsulation - Enclosing data and methods within an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Abstraction - Securing variables and implementation details within objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Inheritance - Extending an object to create a new variation of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Polymorphism - Using a similar object in place of an expected object.\n"

    "### Private Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Like variables, it can be useful to have private methods, methods the user should not directly call. Often these can be helper methods which are performing portions of a calculation that are not useful when run outside of the wider calculation. To include private methods in a class, we start the method name with a `_` character. This does not explicitly make the function private, but by convention informs other developers and users that this method should not be called directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of showing a simple example, let us assume that updating the value of `num_atoms` is a much more complicated procedure than it is under the current definition of `Molecule`. Since we want to keep the content of the symbols setter method fairly straightforward and easy to understand, we create a helper method to handle the updating of `num_atoms`."

    "\n",
    "Inheritance is the principle of extending a class to add capabilities without modifying the original class. We call the class that is being inherited **the parent**, and the class that is inheriting **the child**. The child class obtains the properties and behaviors of its parent unless it overrides them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means a class that inherits from a parent class will contain all of the arguments and methods of the parent class by default. **The child class can either utilize the methods as is or they can override the methods to modify their behavior without affecting the parent class** or any objects that have instantiated that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using inheritance in code development creates a hierarchy of objects, which often improves the readability of your code. It also saves time and effort by avoiding duplicate code production, i.e., inheriting from classes that have similar behavior and modifying them instead of writting a new class from scratch.\n",
