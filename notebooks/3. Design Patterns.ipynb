    "## 3.1. The Adapter Design Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The Adapter design pattern is a method of constructing a wrapper around a pre-existing interface to allow its use by another class. We can construct an individual adapter for a specific class, or create an abstract interface to base our adapter on. An abstract interface will allow us to swap out our adapter for any class that inherits from the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "An adapter is most useful in two different scenarios. The first is when you would like to re-use pre-existing code that has been rigorously tested without modifying it and thus invalidating the tests. The second is when you would like to create code that cares more about getting correct results for a set of inputs than how those results are generated. You may want to create a set of python libraries that can generate the results, but you do not want to re-write your main class to suit each new library."

If we do not want to re-write our code for each individual library, we need to come up with a different solution, in this case it will be to create an adapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use two MD libraries, [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org/) and [MDTraj](http://mdtraj.org/1.9.0/) in this example. Our goal is to create a code that uses `MDTraj` or `MDAnalysis` to perform some simple analysis on a trajectory file. To keep the runtime short, we will only use the center of mass and the [radius of gyration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius_of_gyration) from each code, but the concepts shown will apply to more in depth computations. A sample trajectory file to use is provided in PDB form. We will also be using `NumPy` to structure some of our data."

    "\n",
    "While the above solution was indeed starting to look elegant, we still had to provide the specific adapter ourselves... We solve this by defining a Factory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Factory design pattern is a method that uses a superclass to provide a common interface for the creation of related objects. Subclasses decide which object type should be created and of hide the implementation details of such objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the adapters we previously designed for the two different trajectory analysis tools: `MDAnalysis` and `MDTraj`. Currently we only have two different adapters built, but who knows how many may be constructed in the future. Modifying code to select just between a few toolkits already starts to get tedious if you have to change it a lot. It would be much easier to just take the name of the toolkit you want to use _as a parameter_ and not have to change any code. We want to create a single interface that remains constant that encapsulate the creation of the adapters and abstracts the specifics away.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Factory design pattern suggests to replace direct object construction calls (i.e., instantiating the `MDAnalysisAdapter` or `MDTrajAdapter` classes) with calls to a special class called a factory. This class has a method which returns instances of each adapter and hides the specific instantiation of each. A factory works best when the different constructed classes work from a shared base class, this allows code to use any object produced by the factory in the same way, without even knowing the type of the object they posses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will want to create a new module for our factory, called `factory.py`. We need to first import our adapter abstract class so our factory knows which type of objects it is building."
